What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a git repository which is essential to initiate version control system

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is like a temporary space where files which are to be commited are stored. It sort of prepares them to be commited. I think it makes things fall into place and it is much more comfortable as u can see only the files which are to be commited.
