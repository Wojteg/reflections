How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

In fact that is very helpful for u can see the bug  much easier

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It often happens that we need to make a few steps back. It may be the case that the code we just wrote is simply not working, then we need to restore the previous one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros:
-u can control what u commit and when
-u can commit only what's important

cons:
-u have to be aware of a possible human-error
-u have to remember to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In services like Google Docs it is not important to save multiple files as you work only on one doc, xls etc. document, whereas in git migh have a project that includes multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well obviously u can always go back to the previous versions of your project without any trouble.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Not only am I willing to control my projects using git, but also I would like to share the folder with colleages.
